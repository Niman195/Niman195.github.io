# Niman195.github.io

Welcome to my site! My name is Niman and I have just taken my first step into the world of programming. This is my first web page made with my little knowledge of HTML and CSS that I've learned in this course, I really enjoyed the process of making it, I know it's not much, but I'll try my best to learn more and more since I really enjoy it, I really enjoy the challenges.
This site is about my 4 favorite movies, and I've linked to reviews of each one in case you're interested. 
I hope you enjoy it!
